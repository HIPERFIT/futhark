SYNOPSIS
========

futhark-bench [--runs=count | --compiler=program | --json | --no-validate] programs...

DESCRIPTION
===========

This tool is the recommended way to benchmark Futhark programs.
Programs are compiled using the specified compiler (``futhark-c`` by
default), then run a number of times for each test case, and the
average runtime printed on standard output.  A program will be ignored
if it contains no data sets - it will not even be compiled.

If compilation or running fails, an error message will be printed and
benchmarking will continue (and ``--json`` will write the file), but a
non-zero exit code will be returned at the end.

OPTIONS
=======

--runs=count

  The number of runs per data set.

--compiler=program

  The program used to compile Futhark programs.  This option can be
  passed multiple times, resulting in multiple compilers being used
  for each test case.  The specified program must support the same
  interface as ``futhark-c``.

--runner=program

  If this is set to the non-empty string, compiled programs are not
  run directly, but instead the indicated program is run, with the
  path to the compiled Futhark program passed as the first
  command-line argument.  This is useful for compilation targets that
  cannot be executed directly (like `futhark-cs(1)`), or when you wish
  to run the program on a remote machine.

--json=file

  Write raw results in JSON format to the specified file.

--pass-option=opt

  Pass an option to benchmark programs that are being run.  For
  example, we might want to run OpenCL programs on a specific device::

    futhark-bench prog.fut --compiler=futhark-opencl --pass-option=-dHawaii

--timeout=seconds

  If the runtime for a dataset exceeds this integral number of
  seconds, it is aborted.  Note that the time is allotted not *per
  run*, but for *all runs* for a dataset.  A twenty second limit for
  ten runs thus means each run has only two seconds (minus
  initialisation overhead).

  A negative timeout means to wait indefinitely.

--skip-compilation

  Do not run the compiler, and instead assume that each benchmark
  program has already been compiled.  Use with caution.

--exclude-case=TAG

  Do not run test cases that contain the given tag.  Cases marked with
  "nobench" or "disable" are ignored by default.

--ignore=files=REGEX

  Ignore files whose path match the given regular expression.

EXAMPLES
========

The following program benchmarks how quickly we can sum arrays of
different sizes::

  -- How quickly can we reduce arrays?
  --
  -- ==
  -- nobench input { 0 }
  -- output { 0 }
  -- input { 100 }
  -- output { 4950 }
  -- compiled input { 100000 }
  -- output { 704982704 }
  -- compiled input { 100000000 }
  -- output { 887459712 }

  let main(n: i32): i32 =
    reduce (+) 0 (iota n)
