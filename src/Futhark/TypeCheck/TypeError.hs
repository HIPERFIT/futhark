data GenTypeError vn e t pat =
    TypeError SrcLoc String
  -- ^ A general error happened at the given position and
  -- for the given reason.
  | UnifyError e t e t
  -- ^ Types of two expressions failed to unify.
  | UnexpectedType SrcLoc e t [t]
  -- ^ Expression of type was not one of the expected
  -- types.
  | ReturnTypeError SrcLoc Name t t
  -- ^ The body of a function definition has a different
  -- type than its declaration.
  | DupDefinitionError Name SrcLoc SrcLoc
  -- ^ Two functions have been defined with the same name.
  | DupParamError Name vn SrcLoc
  -- ^ Two function parameters share the same name.
  | DupPatternError vn SrcLoc SrcLoc
  -- ^ Two pattern variables share the same name.
  | InvalidPatternError pat t (Maybe String) SrcLoc
  -- ^ The pattern is not compatible with the type or is otherwise
  -- inconsistent.
  | UnknownVariableError vn SrcLoc
  -- ^ Unknown variable of the given name referenced at the given spot.
  | UnknownFunctionError Name SrcLoc
  -- ^ Unknown function of the given name called at the given spot.
  | ParameterMismatch (Maybe Name) SrcLoc (Either Int [t]) [t]
  -- ^ A function (possibly anonymous) was called with
  -- invalid arguments.  The third argument is either the
  -- number of parameters, or the specific types of
  -- parameters accepted (sometimes, only the former can
  -- be determined).
  | UseAfterConsume vn SrcLoc SrcLoc
  -- ^ A variable was attempted used after being
  -- consumed.  The last location is the point of
  -- consumption.
  | IndexingError vn Int Int SrcLoc
  -- ^ Too many indices provided.  The first integer is
  -- the number of dimensions in the array being
  -- indexed.
  | BadAnnotation SrcLoc String t t
  -- ^ One of the type annotations fails to match with the
  -- derived type.  The string is a description of the
  -- role of the type.  The last type is the new derivation.
  | BadTupleAnnotation SrcLoc String [Maybe t] [t]
  -- ^ One of the tuple type annotations fails to
  -- match with the derived type.  The string is a
  -- description of the role of the type.  The last
  -- type is the elemens of the new derivation.
  | CurriedConsumption Name SrcLoc
  -- ^ A function is being curried with an argument to be consumed.
  | BadLetWithValue SrcLoc
  -- ^ The new value for an array slice in let-with is aliased to the source.
  | ReturnAliased Name vn SrcLoc
  -- ^ The unique return value of the function aliases
  -- one of the function parameters.
  | UniqueReturnAliased Name SrcLoc
  -- ^ A unique element of the tuple returned by the
  -- function aliases some other element of the tuple.
  | NotAnArray SrcLoc e t
  | PermutationError SrcLoc [Int] Int (Maybe vn)
  -- ^ The permutation is not valid.
  | DimensionNotInteger SrcLoc vn
  -- ^ A dimension annotation was a non-integer variable.
